## âœ¨ Coming soon...

A new version written in Vue 3 is currently in progress, which will eventually replace the old Vue 2 version that lives in the `main` branch.
The new version will (hopefully) include all the features from the current website as well as new things like the ability to save drivers & supporting multiple platforms.

This new version is currently in the `next` branch, and also available at <https://acctoolkit-next.bigc.industries> if you wish to give it a try.

Please let me know if you have any feedback using the issues tracker here on GitHub. ðŸ˜Ž
